## Content

### Overview
This decision record documents the implementation of advanced bidding strategies that enhance the turn-taking mechanics in multi-agent dialogues. The implementation provides more sophisticated, context-aware bidding mechanisms to create more natural and effective conversations between agents.

### Implemented Features

The advanced bidding system includes the following key features:

1. **Contextual Relevance Bidding**
   - Analyzes semantic relevance of participants to the current conversation
   - Considers participant expertise in relation to active topics
   - Tracks discussion threads for conversation continuity
   - Increases bid strength for participants with relevant expertise or context

2. **Emotion-Influenced Bidding**
   - Uses emotional states to influence bidding behavior
   - Considers both the participant's own emotions and others' emotional states
   - Analyzes conversation tone to guide appropriate responses
   - Creates more emotionally intelligent turn-taking

3. **Coalition Bidding**
   - Enables participants to form temporary or persistent coalitions around shared viewpoints
   - Provides coalition detection based on agreement patterns
   - Balances speaking turns among coalition members
   - Handles opposition dynamics between competing coalitions

4. **Interruption Mechanics**
   - Adds sophisticated interruption capabilities based on urgency
   - Prevents interruption cascades and manages interruption thresholds
   - Detects factual contradictions that might require urgent correction
   - Respects role hierarchies (e.g., moderators)

5. **Question Responding**
   - Prioritizes responses to relevant questions
   - Detects both explicit and implicit questions
   - Considers question relevance to participant expertise
   - Ensures questions get appropriate responses

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each bidding strategy is implemented as a separate class implementing the IBiddingStrategy interface
2. **Composability**: Strategies can be combined with different weights to create customized bidding behaviors
3. **Extensibility**: The factory pattern enables easy creation and configuration of strategies
4. **Configurability**: All strategies have customizable parameters to tune behavior
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Each strategy includes fallback approaches when full context isn't available

### Factory Design

An AdvancedBiddingStrategyFactory class provides:

1. Factory methods for individual strategies with customizable parameters
2. Pre-configured combinations for specific use cases:
   - Default strategy with balanced components
   - Debate-optimized strategy prioritizing topic relevance and rebuttals
   - Consensus-building strategy emphasizing coalition dynamics
   - Brainstorming strategy encouraging broader participation
   - Moderator strategy focused on intervention and question management

### Technical Details

The implementation consists of:

1. Core interfaces defining bid contexts and strategy contracts
2. Implementation classes for each strategy type
3. Extended context interfaces for different bidding approaches
4. Factory class with creation and composition methods
5. Integration with existing bidding framework
6. Example implementation demonstrating the use of various bidding strategies

### Example Implementation

A complete example showcasing advanced bidding strategies is available at `examples/advanced_bidding_example.ts`. This example demonstrates:

1. Creation of participants with different advanced bidding strategies:
   - Moderator with interruption-focused bidding
   - Debate-oriented participant optimized for critical analysis
   - Consensus-building participant focused on finding common ground
   - Brainstorming-oriented participant prioritizing creative ideas
   - Custom participant with a tailored bidding configuration

2. Running a dialogue with these participants to show how different bidding strategies affect turn-taking dynamics

3. Analysis of turn distribution to demonstrate how bidding strategies influence conversation participation patterns

The example provides a practical reference for implementing and configuring advanced bidding strategies in different dialogue contexts.
