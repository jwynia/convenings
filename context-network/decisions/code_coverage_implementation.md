# Code Coverage Implementation

## Purpose
This document records the decision to implement code coverage tracking and reporting for the project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Testing, Quality Assurance
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

### Context

Code coverage is a critical metric for understanding the effectiveness of our test suite. After successfully implementing dependency injection and setting up a CI pipeline, the natural next step in our testing quality improvement plan was to implement code coverage tracking.

### Decision

We decided to use Deno's built-in coverage tools for code coverage analysis due to their seamless integration with the existing development workflow. The implementation includes:

1. Test execution with coverage collection
2. Multiple report formats (console, detailed, HTML, LCOV)
3. Integration with the CI pipeline
4. Artifact generation for historical tracking

### Implementation Approach

1. **Local Development:**
   - Added coverage-specific tasks to `deno.json`
   - Created a comprehensive coverage workflow that generates multiple report formats
   - Ensured detailed reporting to identify specific uncovered areas

2. **CI Integration:**
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to generate coverage reports during CI runs
   - Configured artifact upload to preserve coverage reports
   - Set retention period for historical comparison

3. **Coverage Thresholds:**
   - Current overall coverage: 89.5% (line coverage)
   - Target thresholds:
     - Line coverage: 90% (near current level)
     - Branch coverage: 90% (near current level of 92.9%)
   - Critical components should maintain 95%+ coverage

### Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance:** Identifies untested code paths to guide testing efforts
2. **Regression Prevention:** Helps maintain test coverage as code evolves
3. **Confidence:** Provides measurable metrics for code reliability
4. **Documentation:** Coverage reports serve as living documentation of tested functionality
5. **Historical Tracking:** Allows monitoring of coverage trends over time

### Considerations

1. **Beyond Metrics:** Coverage percentages alone don't guarantee quality tests
2. **Strategic Coverage:** Some code paths are more critical than others
3. **Maintenance Overhead:** Coverage reports require interpretation and action
4. **Performance Impact:** Coverage collection adds minimal overhead to test execution

### Alternatives Considered

1. **External Coverage Tools:** Tools like c8 or Istanbul could provide additional features but would add complexity and external dependencies.
2. **Manual Coverage Tracking:** Rejected as too labor-intensive and error-prone.
3. **No Coverage Tracking:** Rejected as it would limit our ability to measure and improve test effectiveness.
