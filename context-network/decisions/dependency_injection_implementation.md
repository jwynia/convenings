# Architectural Decision Record: Dependency Injection Implementation

## Purpose
This document records the architectural decision regarding the implementation of a dependency injection pattern in the project, including the considered alternatives, selection criteria, and rationale for the chosen approach.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture, Testing
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

### Status
**Status:** Approved
**Decision Date:** 2025-05-31
**Implemented:** Yes

### Context
As part of our testing quality improvement initiative, we need to implement a dependency injection pattern to improve the testability of our code. This will enable easier mocking of dependencies during unit testing and promote a more modular, loosely coupled architecture.

Current challenges that this decision addresses:
1. Components have hard dependencies that make unit testing difficult
2. Mock implementations need to be manually created and injected in test code
3. Component dependencies are not explicitly documented or consistently managed
4. Test coverage is limited by the difficulty of isolating components from their dependencies

### Decision Drivers
The following factors are driving this architectural decision:
1. Need for improved testability of components
2. Desire for more modular and maintainable code
3. Compatibility with Deno's module system and idioms
4. Performance considerations
5. Developer experience and learning curve
6. Long-term maintainability of the codebase

### Considered Options

#### Option 1: Constructor Injection with Factory Functions
**Description:** Implement dependency injection by passing dependencies as parameters to constructor functions. Use factory functions to create instances with their dependencies.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Service definition
class UserService {
  constructor(private readonly database: Database) {}
  
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.database.findUser(id);
  }
}

// Factory function
function createUserService(database: Database): UserService {
  return new UserService(database);
}

// Usage
const userService = createUserService(database);
```

**Pros:**
- Simple and explicit
- No external libraries required
- Clear dependency relationships
- Easy to test with mocks
- Compatible with Deno's module system

**Cons:**
- Requires manual wiring of dependencies
- Factory functions add boilerplate
- No automatic resolution of transitive dependencies

#### Option 2: Service Locator Pattern
**Description:** Implement a central registry (service locator) that components can use to request their dependencies.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Service locator
class ServiceLocator {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  
  register<T>(key: string, service: T): void {
    this.services.set(key, service);
  }
  
  resolve<T>(key: string): T {
    const service = this.services.get(key);
    if (!service) {
      throw new Error(`Service not found: ${key}`);
    }
    return service as T;
  }
}

// Usage
const locator = new ServiceLocator();
locator.register('database', new Database());

class UserService {
  private database: Database;
  
  constructor(locator: ServiceLocator) {
    this.database = locator.resolve('database');
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

**Pros:**
- Centralized dependency management
- Components request what they need
- No need for extensive constructor parameter lists
- Can be configured at runtime

**Cons:**
- Dependencies are not explicit in function signatures
- Can lead to hidden dependencies
- Testing requires setting up the service locator
- Service location is a form of global state

#### Option 3: Decorators-based DI Container (if TypeScript decorators are used)
**Description:** Use TypeScript decorators to mark injectable services and their dependencies, with a container that handles instantiation.

**Example:**
```typescript
// With a hypothetical DI library
@Injectable()
class UserService {
  constructor(
    @Inject() private readonly database: Database
  ) {}
  
  // Methods...
}

// Container setup
const container = new DIContainer();
container.register(Database, DatabaseImpl);
container.register(UserService);

// Usage
const userService = container.resolve(UserService);
```

**Pros:**
- Automatic resolution of dependencies
- Clean syntax with decorators
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Powerful features like scoping and lifecycle management

**Cons:**
- Relies on TypeScript decorators (experimental feature)
- May require external library
- More complex implementation
- May not align well with Deno's philosophy of simplicity
- Runtime overhead

#### Option 4: Dependency Injection through Higher-Order Functions
**Description:** Use higher-order functions to inject dependencies into service functions.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Service as a higher-order function
function createUserService(database: Database) {
  return {
    getUser: async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
      return database.findUser(id);
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const userService = createUserService(database);
const user = await userService.getUser('123');
```

**Pros:**
- Functional approach that aligns with modern JavaScript
- Simple to implement and understand
- Explicit dependencies
- Works well with Deno's module system
- Easy to test

**Cons:**
- Less suitable for complex object hierarchies
- May lead to verbose code for services with many methods
- No automatic resolution of dependencies

### Decision Outcome
**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Constructor Injection with Factory Functions

**Rationale:** 
After evaluating all options, Constructor Injection with Factory Functions was selected for the following reasons:
1. Simplicity and clarity - The pattern is straightforward to implement and understand
2. Explicit dependencies - Dependencies are clearly visible in function signatures
3. Compatibility with Deno - Aligns well with Deno's module system and philosophy
4. No external dependencies - Can be implemented without additional libraries
5. Minimal boilerplate - Compared to other options, requires less additional code
6. Easy to test - Makes unit testing with mock dependencies straightforward

**Consequences:**
1. Positive:
   - Improved testability by making it easy to inject mock implementations
   - Clear dependency documentation through function signatures
   - Flexible configuration of components with different implementations
   - Simple to understand and use for all team members
   - Compatible with incremental adoption throughout the codebase

2. Negative:
   - Additional code required for factory functions and interfaces
   - Some initial refactoring effort for existing components
   - Manual dependency wiring (no automatic resolution)

### Implementation Plan
1. Create interfaces for core utilities to enable dependency injection
2. Refactor string utilities to work with the DI pattern
3. Modify the ConversationAgent to use dependency injection
4. Apply the DI pattern to core Mastra functionality
5. Update tests to leverage the new DI capabilities
6. Document patterns and update guidelines for future development
7. Gradually expand to other parts of the codebase

### Validation
The implementation will be considered successful if:
1. Unit tests can easily provide mock implementations of dependencies
2. Test coverage increases due to improved testability, especially for error cases
3. Components have clear, explicit dependencies documented in constructor signatures
4. The solution doesn't introduce significant performance overhead
5. Developers can understand and effectively use the pattern without extensive training
6. Previously difficult-to-test scenarios can now be effectively tested
