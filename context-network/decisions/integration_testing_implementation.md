# Integration Testing Implementation

## Purpose
This document records the decision on how to implement integration testing for the project, with specific focus on testing component interactions without invoking external LLM APIs.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Testing, Quality Assurance
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Context
The project has successfully implemented:
1. A dependency injection pattern for component decoupling
2. A CI pipeline for automated testing
3. Code coverage tracking and reporting

Unit tests now provide good coverage of individual components (89.5% line coverage, 92.9% branch coverage), but there's a need to verify that components interact correctly when integrated together. Additionally, there's a specific requirement to avoid any integration tests that would invoke actual LLM APIs to prevent unexpected costs.

### Decision
Implement an integration testing strategy with the following key elements:

1. Create a dedicated integration test structure separate from unit tests
2. Use mock implementations for all external service dependencies, especially LLM APIs
3. Leverage the existing dependency injection framework to substitute production implementations with test doubles
4. Focus on key interaction points between major system components (Convenings API, Mastra implementation, etc.)
5. Establish clear test fixtures and utilities to support maintainable integration tests

### Status
In Progress

### Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- Improved confidence in component interactions
- Early detection of integration issues
- Enhanced documentation of expected component behavior
- No risk of unexpected LLM API costs during testing

**Negative consequences:**
- Additional maintenance burden for test fixtures and mocks
- Some complexity in setting up realistic test environments
- Cannot verify actual LLM interactions without explicit opt-in

**Risks:**
- Mock implementations may not perfectly replicate actual service behavior
- Complex interactions might be difficult to simulate without actual service calls
- Test environments might diverge from production over time

**Trade-offs:**
- Safety and cost control vs. comprehensive real-world testing
- Test isolation vs. realistic integration verification
- Maintenance complexity vs. test coverage

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Full Environment Integration Tests
Run tests against actual service implementations including LLM API calls.

**Pros:**
- Most realistic testing of actual production behavior
- Verifies end-to-end workflows completely
- Catches issues with actual API responses

**Cons:**
- Unpredictable costs from LLM API calls
- Tests may be flaky due to external service dependencies
- Slower test execution

#### Alternative 2: Snapshot-Based Testing
Use recorded API responses for integration tests.

**Pros:**
- No direct API costs after initial recording
- Tests run against actual (though historic) API responses
- Faster than live API testing

**Cons:**
- Responses may become outdated over time
- Difficult to cover all possible interaction patterns
- Maintenance burden for keeping snapshots updated

#### Alternative 3: Contract Testing
Focus only on verifying interface contracts between components.

**Pros:**
- Lightweight approach requiring less setup
- Clear focus on interface boundaries
- Easy to maintain

**Cons:**
- Doesn't verify actual integration behavior
- Limited coverage of complex interactions
- May miss subtle integration issues

### Implementation Notes

1. **Integration Test Directory Structure:**
   ```
   src/
   └── integration_tests/
       ├── fixtures/          # Test fixtures and helpers
       ├── convenings/        # Tests for Convenings API integration
       ├── mastra/            # Tests for Mastra component integration
       └── workflows/         # Tests for end-to-end workflows
   ```

2. **Mock Implementation Approach:**
   - Create standardized mock factories for external services
   - Implement predictable response patterns for LLM API mocks
   - Store test fixtures as static JSON/YAML files for consistency

3. **Test Data Management:**
   - Use consistent test data across integration tests
   - Establish clear state setup and teardown patterns
   - Document test data assumptions for maintainability

4. **CI Integration:**
   - Add integration tests as a separate CI step after unit tests
   - Configure appropriate timeouts for potentially longer-running tests
   - Generate separate coverage reports for integration tests

5. **LLM Testing Guidelines:**
   - Implement a clear toggle mechanism for enabling actual LLM API calls
   - Require explicit opt-in configuration for any tests using real APIs
   - Document expected costs and usage patterns for LLM-enabled tests
