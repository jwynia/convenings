# Modular Agent Interaction Patterns

## Purpose
This document records a key decision regarding the architectural approach for making different agent interaction patterns (flows, networks, delegation) modular and easily switchable, and establishes broader process principles for component design.

## Classification
- **Domain:** System Architecture
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Context
The multi-agent dialogue system currently uses a workflow-based integration with Mastra, but there's uncertainty about whether Mastra flows, Mastra networks, or direct agent delegation would be the optimal approach. Rather than committing to one pattern, there's a need for an architecture that allows easy switching between these approaches as requirements evolve and as we learn more about their respective strengths and weaknesses.

Beyond this specific architectural decision, there's a desire to establish broader process principles that emphasize small, reusable, extensible, and composable components across the entire system, avoiding solutions that are needlessly specific to immediate questions.

### Decision
1. **Implement an abstract interaction layer** that standardizes how multi-agent systems communicate, with concrete implementations for flow-based, network-based, and delegation-based interaction patterns.

2. **Use a strategy pattern and dependency injection** to allow runtime selection of the appropriate interaction pattern.

3. **Adopt a configuration-driven approach** for selecting and configuring interaction patterns.

4. **Establish core process principles** for all component development:
   - **Composability**: Components should be easily combined with others
   - **Reusability**: Components should be designed for multiple contexts
   - **Extensibility**: Components should be easy to extend without modification
   - **Modularity**: Components should have clear boundaries and interfaces
   - **Abstraction**: Implementation details should be hidden behind well-defined interfaces

### Status
Accepted

### Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- Flexibility to switch interaction patterns with minimal code changes
- Ability to experimentally compare different approaches in the same application
- Reduced coupling between components
- More testable code with clearer boundaries
- Ability to evolve the system incrementally without major rewrites
- Long-term maintainability and adaptability

**Negative consequences:**
- Additional architectural complexity
- Overhead of maintaining abstraction layers
- Potential performance impact from indirection
- Learning curve for developers to understand the abstraction

**Risks:**
- Abstract interfaces might not capture all requirements of specific implementation approaches
- Over-abstraction could make the system harder to understand
- Some unique capabilities of specific patterns might be lost in the abstraction

**Trade-offs:**
- Flexibility vs. simplicity
- Generic interfaces vs. pattern-specific optimizations
- Development speed vs. long-term maintainability

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Commit to Flow-Based Architecture
Fully commit to the workflow-based Mastra integration without abstraction for alternative patterns.

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation with fewer abstraction layers
- More direct alignment with current Mastra integration
- Faster initial development

**Cons:**
- Limited flexibility to change approaches later
- Potential rework if flows prove suboptimal for certain use cases
- Higher coupling between components

#### Alternative 2: Create Multiple Separate Implementations
Implement multiple independent systems for flows, networks, and delegation without a unifying abstraction.

**Pros:**
- Each implementation can be optimized for its specific pattern
- No compromise on features for abstraction compatibility
- No overhead from abstraction layers

**Cons:**
- Code duplication
- Difficulty switching between approaches
- Higher maintenance burden
- Inconsistent interfaces and behavior

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach with Pattern-Specific Extensions
Create a base abstraction but allow pattern-specific extensions for unique capabilities.

**Pros:**
- Balance between unification and pattern-specific features
- More flexible abstraction
- Potentially better performance for specialized features

**Cons:**
- More complex interface design
- Risk of abstraction leakage
- Could evolve into separate implementations over time

### Implementation Notes

The implementation will involve creating the following components:

1. **Abstract Interface Definition**:
```typescript
// Abstract interface for all multi-agent interaction patterns
interface IAgentInteractionSystem {
  initialize(config: InteractionConfig): Promise<void>;
  addAgent(agent: Agent): void;
  start(topic: string): Promise<InteractionResult>;
  pause(): void;
  resume(): void;
  stop(): Promise<InteractionResult>;
  onEvent(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
}
```

2. **Concrete Implementations**:
```typescript
// Concrete implementations
class FlowBasedInteraction implements IAgentInteractionSystem {
  // Implementation using Mastra workflows
}

class NetworkBasedInteraction implements IAgentInteractionSystem {
  // Implementation using agent networks
}

class DelegationBasedInteraction implements IAgentInteractionSystem {
  // Implementation using delegation patterns
}
```

3. **Factory for Creating Implementations**:
```typescript
class InteractionStrategyFactory {
  static create(
    type: 'flow' | 'network' | 'delegation', 
    config: InteractionConfig
  ): IAgentInteractionSystem {
    switch(type) {
      case 'flow':
        return new FlowBasedInteraction(config);
      case 'network':
        return new NetworkBasedInteraction(config);
      case 'delegation':
        return new DelegationBasedInteraction(config);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown interaction type: ${type}`);
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Configuration System**:
```typescript
// In your application configuration
const config = {
  interaction: {
    type: 'flow', // or 'network' or 'delegation'
    params: {
      // Type-specific configuration parameters
    }
  },
  // Other configuration...
};
```

5. **Common Data Models** for interaction context and results to ensure consistency across implementations.

The implementation will be phased, starting with adapters for the current flow-based system, then progressively implementing the network and delegation approaches.
