### Project Overview

Convenings is a multi-agent dialogue framework for Deno that enables sophisticated conversational interactions between multiple AI agents. It provides a structured environment for agents with different roles, motivations, and behaviors to engage in meaningful dialogues, collaboratively explore topics, and reach consensus on complex issues.

The framework integrates with multiple LLM providers through the OpenRouter API, offering a flexible architecture for creating diverse dialogue scenarios from simple conversations to complex consensus-building sessions.

### Vision Statement

To create the most powerful and flexible framework for multi-agent dialogue systems, enabling more natural, nuanced, and productive AI-driven conversations that enhance human-AI collaboration and decision-making.

### Mission Statement

Convenings provides developers with a sophisticated toolkit for creating multi-agent dialogue systems that feature realistic turn-taking dynamics, motivation-driven behaviors, and specialized workflows for different conversational goals. By abstracting the complexities of prompt engineering and agent orchestration, Convenings enables the creation of AI conversations that are more engaging, nuanced, and productive than single-agent interactions.

### Project Objectives

1. Create a flexible framework for multi-agent dialogues with clear separation of concerns between participants, workflows, and providers
2. Implement psychologically-grounded motivation systems for more realistic agent behaviors
3. Develop specialized workflows for different dialogue goals (consensus, debate, brainstorming, etc.)
4. Provide easy integration with multiple LLM providers through a unified API
5. Deliver a simple, intuitive API for common use cases while allowing advanced customization
6. Build a comprehensive set of examples and documentation to facilitate adoption

### Success Criteria

1. Implementation of at least five specialized dialogue workflows for different use cases
2. Support for at least three different motivation types with configurable parameters
3. Integration with multiple LLM providers through OpenRouter with fallback capabilities
4. Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) with both unit and integration tests
5. Performance benchmarks showing efficient token usage compared to single-agent alternatives
6. Creation of at least three domain-specific applications demonstrating real-world utility

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Multi-agent dialogue framework with clear separation of concerns
- Motivation-driven participant behaviors and bidding strategies
- Specialized workflows for different dialogue types (consensus, debate, etc.)
- OpenRouter integration for multi-model support
- Memory and context management for persistent dialogue state
- Configuration API for customizing dialogue behaviors
- Command-line and programmatic interfaces
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

#### Out of Scope

- Web or GUI interface (may be developed as a separate project)
- End-user applications (focus is on providing a developer framework)
- Training or fine-tuning of models (uses existing LLM providers)
- Multi-modal inputs/outputs beyond text (initially text-only)
- Real-time voice interaction (initially text-based only)
- Integration with specific business systems or workflows

### Stakeholders

| Ecosystem | December 2025 | Plugin system, templates, multi-modal support |

### Budget and Resources

As an open-source project, Convenings relies on contributor time and potentially token usage for LLM API calls during development and testing. Key resource considerations include:

- Developer time for implementation and maintenance
- API costs for development, testing, and demonstrations
- Documentation and example creation resources
- Community building and support resources

### Constraints

- Token limits of underlying LLM models
- API rate limits and costs from LLM providers
- Performance considerations for real-time dialogue
- Complexity of managing state across multiple agents
- Deno runtime environment constraints

### Assumptions

- LLMs will continue to improve in their ability to maintain coherent dialogue
- OpenRouter or similar services will provide reliable access to multiple models
- A standardized approach to multi-agent dialogue will provide value over ad-hoc implementations
- Users will prefer higher-level abstractions for complex multi-agent scenarios
- TypeScript and Deno will remain viable platforms for this type of framework

### Risks

- LLM API changes could require significant adaptation
- Token usage costs could become prohibitive for certain applications
- Complex configuration options might create a steep learning curve
- Performance bottlenecks in large-scale dialogues
- Integration challenges with different LLM providers
