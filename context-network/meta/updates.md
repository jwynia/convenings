- Updated `context-network/planning/testing_quality_improvement_plan.md`: Updated progress tracking for the dependency injection task

### Implementation Changes
- Created `src/utils/interfaces.ts`: Defined core interfaces for dependency injection, starting with IStringUtils
- Updated `src/utils/string_utils.ts`: Refactored to implement the IStringUtils interface and provide factory functions
- Updated `src/utils/mod.ts`: Enhanced exports to include interfaces and factories
- Updated `src/mastra/agents/conversation_agent.ts`: Refactored to use dependency injection for string utilities
- Updated `src/mastra/agents/tests/conversation_agent_test.ts`: Enhanced tests to leverage dependency injection for better testing

### New Relationships Established
- `context-network/decisions/dependency_injection_implementation.md` → implements → `context-network/planning/testing_quality_improvement_plan.md`
- `src/utils/interfaces.ts` → is-parent-of → All interface implementations
- `src/utils/string_utils.ts` → implements → `src/utils/interfaces.ts`
- `src/mastra/agents/conversation_agent.ts` → depends-on → `src/utils/interfaces.ts`

### Navigation Implications
- Dependency injection implementation provides a new pattern for component dependencies
- Tests now demonstrate how to use mock implementations for dependencies
- Future components should follow the established pattern of interfaces, implementations, and factory functions

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Apply the dependency injection pattern to additional components in the codebase
- Create interface definitions for other utility services and core components
- Update tests for other components to leverage dependency injection for better test coverage
- Document the dependency injection pattern in `elements/deno/best_practices.md`
- Consider enhancing error handling with more specific error types

## Context Network Update: Testing Quality Improvement Plan - 2025-05-31

### Information Nodes Modified/Created
- Created `planning/testing_quality_improvement_plan.md`: Comprehensive plan for implementing testing and quality improvements in a logical sequence

### Content Changes
- Established clear sequence for implementing testing improvements: dependency injection → CI pipeline → code coverage → integration testing
- Defined action tasks and planning tasks for each improvement area
- Created progress tracking table to monitor implementation status
- Documented detailed considerations for each improvement area
- Specified context network update requirements for each completed task

### Navigation Implications
- The testing improvement plan provides a clear next-action structure
- Progress tracking table serves as the primary indicator of what to work on next
- Related documents in elements/deno/testing.md, processes/validation.md, and decisions/ will be
